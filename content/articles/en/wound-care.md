## Basic Wound Care Principles

### 1. Keep It Clean

- Wash your hands thoroughly before touching the wound
- Use clean water and mild soap to gently clean around the wound
- Pat dry with a clean towel

### 2. Monitor for Infection

Watch for these warning signs:

| Sign      | What to Look For                          | Action Needed                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Redness   | Spreading redness around wound edges      | Contact healthcare provider               |
| Swelling  | Increased swelling or warmth              | Monitor closely, seek advice if worsening |
| Discharge | Yellow or green pus, foul odor            | Immediate medical attention               |
| Pain      | Increasing pain after initial improvement | Call your doctor                          |
