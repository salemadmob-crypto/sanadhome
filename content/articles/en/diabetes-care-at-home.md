## 1. Blood Sugar Monitoring

Regular monitoring is the cornerstone of diabetes management. It helps you understand how food, exercise, and medication affect your blood sugar levels.

| Time of Test          | Target Blood Sugar Range (mg/dL) | Target Blood Sugar Range (mmol/L) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Before meals          | 80–130                           | 4.4–7.2                           |
| Two hours after meals | < 180                            | < 10.0                            |

**Tips for Accurate Monitoring:**

- Wash your hands with soap and warm water before testing.
- Use a fresh lancet for each test.
- Keep a log of your readings to share with your healthcare provider.

## 2. Diet and Nutrition

A balanced diet is essential for keeping blood sugar levels stable. Focus on a diet rich in nutrients and low in processed sugars and unhealthy fats.

### The Plate Method

A simple way to plan your meals:

- **Half your plate:** Non-starchy vegetables (e.g., broccoli, spinach, peppers).
- **One quarter of your plate:** Lean protein (e.g., chicken, fish, beans).
- **One quarter of your plate:** Complex carbohydrates (e.g., brown rice, quinoa, whole-wheat bread).

## 3. Medication and Insulin Management

Adhering to your prescribed medication schedule is vital. Whether you take oral medications or insulin, consistency is key.

| Medication Type    | Common Goal                               | Key Considerations                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Oral Medication    | Improve insulin sensitivity or production | Take at the same time each day as prescribed.    |
| Insulin Injections | Regulate blood glucose levels directly    | Rotate injection sites to prevent skin problems. |

## 4. The Role of Home Nursing

A professional home nurse from SanadHome can provide invaluable support:

- **Education:** Teaching the patient and family about diabetes management.
- **Monitoring:** Assisting with regular blood sugar checks and identifying warning signs.
- **Wound Care:** Managing diabetic foot ulcers and other related wounds.
- **Medication Administration:** Ensuring correct dosage and timing of insulin and other medications.

By integrating professional home care with a diligent self-management routine, you can effectively control diabetes and prevent complications.
