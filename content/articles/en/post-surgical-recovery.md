Recovering from surgery doesn't end when you leave the hospital. The post-surgical period at home is critical for healing, preventing complications, and regaining strength. A well-structured home recovery plan can make all the difference.

## 1. Wound Care and Infection Prevention

Proper wound care is paramount to prevent infection and promote healing.

**Key Steps for Wound Care:**

- **Keep it Clean and Dry:** Follow your surgeon's instructions on when and how to clean the incision site.
- **Watch for Signs of Infection:** Redness, swelling, increased pain, pus, or fever are warning signs.
- **Dressing Changes:** Use sterile techniques as taught by your healthcare provider.

| Sign of Infection          | Action to Take                                              |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increased Redness/Swelling | Contact your doctor or home care nurse immediately.         |
| Pus or Drainage            | Do not attempt to drain it yourself. Seek medical advice.   |
| Fever (>101°F / 38.3°C)    | This could indicate a systemic infection. Call your doctor. |

## 2. Pain Management

Managing pain is not just about comfort; it's crucial for mobility and recovery. Uncontrolled pain can hinder your ability to walk, sleep, and participate in physical therapy.

**Pain Management Strategies:**

- **Medication:** Take prescribed pain medication on schedule, not just when the pain becomes severe.
- **Non-Pharmacological Methods:** Ice packs, elevation, and comfortable positioning can significantly reduce pain.

## 3. Mobility and Physical Therapy

Early and appropriate movement is key to preventing complications like blood clots and pneumonia.

| Activity Level       | Goal                                      | Professional Support                                       |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early Mobilization   | Prevent blood clots, improve circulation. | A physical therapist can guide you on safe movements.      |
| Prescribed Exercises | Regain strength and range of motion.      | A home nurse can ensure you are doing exercises correctly. |
